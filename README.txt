Hello and welcome to my To-Do Application

HOW TO USE:

    1: Type a task into the input field at the top of the page.
    2: Enter the required date that the task must be completed by.

        Please ote that these two fields are required to have an input or an alert will appear telling you to input in both fields.

    3: Click the "Add Task" button.

    Once the task is added to the active task list you can either click the "Edit" or "Complete" button.

    If the "Edit" button is clicked, both the text field and the date input of the form will become editable.
    Click the "Save" button to commit your changes.

    If, while in the edit state, you want to delete the entry, you must click the red "Delete" button to which you will be 
    alerted of if you are sure you wish to delete this specific entry.
    If you confirm to delete the entry, it will be removed from the page and the local storage.

    Once your task is completed, you may click the "Complete" button to which it will move to the "Completed Tasks" section of the page
    and you will notice its completion confirmation with a visual strike-through the whole entry.

    The entry in the "Completed Tasks" section can still have functionally, such as if you wish to undo the task, you can by clicking
    the "Undo" button, to which the task will return to the "Tasks" list and receive the functionally that comes with active tasks.

    The completed tasks also have the delete function, for a clean-up purpose.

    You will find two sorting buttons underneath and to the right of the "Tasks" heading.
    Selction by either the "Sort by Name" or "Sort by Date" buttons will sort the active task list in accending order respectively.
    Clicking either buttons will sort the active list again in decending order and if again, back to accending order.

Thank you for using my To-Do App
